Raised on the east-coast of Australia in a small town of Bangalow. 
Inez Brookes has a vision to create beautifully polished and creative photographs inspired by her home town, Bangalow on the sunny east coast of Australia. 
Having shifted between the urban and rural lifestyle, Inez aims to merge the innovative and modern influences from inner city Sydney with the rustic and funky energy of Byron Bay. 
Her fashion and beauty photographs redefine the cosmopolitan woman, adding a unique and expressive nature to the mainstream. </p>
